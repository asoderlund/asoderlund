## Synopsis
This project is a continuation of a previous project I worked on for a class involving visualization. 
I chose to update the existing visualization I had already created that I was not completely happy with using Tableau, and created a Tableau Public page online. 

This project includes:
- Importing and cleansing a large dataset in Tableau 
- Creating calculated fields and LOD expressions
- Creating a map showing multiple variables
- Creating a custom legend
- Creating an interactive dashboard

## The Dataset
The dataset used for this project comes from the USDA Research Data Archive. It contains information about wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2018. It is a conglomeration of data from several different fire organizations at federal, state, and local levels. This dataset contains specifics about the location, size, date, causes, and other information for every wildfire in the United States. I also incoporated a dataset including the land area of counties in the US. 

Specifically, this project focused on the variables involving the location, duration, size, and number of wildfires for each county.
