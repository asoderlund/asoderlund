Hi! I'm Alyssa Soderlund. I am currently studying for my masters of engineering in data analytics at George Mason University. I am a former teacher transitioning into the world of data science!

I received my bachelors in mathematics and minor in computer science from Christopher Newport University in December 2018. My passion for data science began when I found that I could apply both mathematics and programming to data science problems.

I have always been the kind of person who loves to solve puzzles, and I see every dataset as a puzzle just waiting to be solved. It is fascinating to see what secrets can be unearthed from the analytics process.
