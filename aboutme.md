Hi! I'm Alyssa Soderlund. I am currently studying for my masters of engineering in data analytics at George Mason University. I am a former teacher transitioning into the world of data science!

I received my bachelors in mathematics and minor in computer science from Christopher Newport University in December 2018. My passion for data science began when I found that I could apply both mathematics and programming to data science problems.

I have always been the kind of person who loves to solve puzzles, and I see every dataset as a puzzle just waiting to be solved. It is fascinating to see what secrets can be unearthed from the analytics process.

If you would like to know more about my background, check out my LinkedIn profile and my portfolio projects!
